## Configure your device ##

It's finally time to put everything together on your RaspberryPi and set up the connection!

(Full official tutorial for developing your device software can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/iot-cloud/iotgs/developing-device-software-using-client-software-libraries1.html "Developing Device Software Using the Client Software Libraries").)

To make things easier, we have prepared some sample code which you can download directly to the RaspberryPi using Git.

1. SSH to your RaspberryPi, for example using Putty if you are on a windows client.
2. Navigate to the folder XXX.
3. Clone the repository by entering : git clone https://github.com/DiscoTechOracle/IoT-Meetup.git


You have now successfully registered your RaspberryPi as a device in the IoT Cloud Service! Time for the next step!
