## The Challenges ##

Now onto some interesting challenges. Here we will not guide like in the tutorial but some tips and hints will be given.

1. Preliminary. <Build a Python client that does something similar to the C client in the tutorial or something totally different, it is up to you to dazzle us!>

2. Even though doing real coding is awesome sometimes you need to quickly create some devices with sensors that might not even be built yet. The answer to this is Simulators. Try to build a simulator and use it in the IoT Server.

3. Of course you brought your own Raspberry to the event! Now it is time to replicate what we have done but without the added help of templates and stuff!

4. Ask the Meetup leaders for another type of sensor and connect it to the Raspberry and try to use it with the iotclient code or your own code. This will involve understanding the protocol used by these sensors.
