## The Challenges ##

Now on to some interesting challenges. Here we will not guide like in the tutorials. If you complete 3 of these then you will get a nice prize and a permanent place in the IoT Gurus Hall of Fame on our Meetup.com site!

1. Build a Python client that does something similar to the C client in the tutorial or something totally different, it is up to you to dazzle us! Here we need to explore the REST APIs of the IoT Server since there are no client libraries for Python. You might involve the DHT22 sensor or just send some sample data to the server.

2. Even though doing real coding is awesome, sometimes you need to quickly create some devices with sensors where the hardware has not even been built yet. The answer to this is Simulators. Try to build a simulator and use it in the IoT Server.

3. Of course you brought your own Raspberry to the event! Now it is time to replicate what we have done but without the added help of templates and crutches!

4. Ask the Meetup leaders to get to try another type of sensor, the *DS18B20* and connect it to the Raspberry. Then try to use it with the iotclient.c code or your own code. This will involve understanding the 1-Wire protocol used by these sensors. This is uncharted territory so only for the real techies!
