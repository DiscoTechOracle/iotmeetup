## Create the IoT Client code ##

Now we will start to code the actual IoT Client.
As most TV Chefs we don't start from scratch, we have a template to start with.

Move to the bin directory of the project

`cd iotcs/posix/bin`

 And copy the template to the file we will use as per below.

`cp iotclient_template.c iotclient.c`


Now I'm sure you would like to add some features that make this usable in production.
